# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# movie1 = Movie.create(title: "Hamza", release_date: 1994, description: "test", poster: "img", price: 1000, movie_type: "Drama", address: "Paris 11")
Movie.create([title: "Hamza"])
